# Running the application

To run the application simply clone the repository and execute the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will install all dependencies, build the app and start a local server (usually at http://localhost:8080/).

Refer to the terminal for the actual URL and port.

# Production Build

To compile a production build run:

```
npm run build
```

After the build has finished you can publish the `./thebrand/dist` folder.
